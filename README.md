# Tutorial

You can find a tutorial on using the engine in the following file : 
[octopusSQL TUTORIAL.pdf](https://github.com/AyaHamedd/octopusSQL/blob/main/OctopusDB-using%20SQL%20Queries%20tutorial.pdf).


## Features
- Supports Int and text datatypes
   - INT : -2147483648 to 2147483647
   - TEXT : Any kind of text data including spaces.
- Supports primary key constrain.
- Validates databases and tables names as they can't contain any characters or spaces and can't contain only numbers. 
- Reading, Deleting and Updating records by applying multiple conditions.
- Updating and deleting multiple records in one command.



## Database Architecture
The main directory that holds all databases is called octopusdb, located in your home directory. Each database has a directory under  octopusdb with its name. Then each database has two directories;
- data : Contains tables data files , where records of each table is stored.
- metadata : Contains tables metadata , where columns, datatypes and constrains are stored.

The main script that receives inputs from user is octopus. Each command has its own script. Octopus starts calling the corresponding script based on userâ€™s requirements.
